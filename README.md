# Link-Shortner-in-Django
A URL shortener is a simple tool that takes a long URL and turns it into whatever URL you would like it to be.

# What is Django?
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, 
it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source

**Django emphasizes the following:**
- Pluggability and reusability of components
- Quick development
- The principle of non repetition

# What is a URL shortener?
I want to clarify that a URL shortener is the same as a link shortener… is the same as a link shrinker… a link compressor… a URL condenser… a vanity URL creator… I think that’s them all covered. They are all different ways of saying the same thing, which is that we want to take something long and ugly, then make it short and cute. To keep it simple, I will stick with the term URL shortener from today until the day I die.

# How it works
Basically, when the URL shortener gives you your shortened URL, it "remembers" the full address. When other users go to the shortened URL, they will be automatically redirected to the full address.

The webpage will still exist at the longer URL—the shortened URL is simply a shortcut to make the link easier to manage.
