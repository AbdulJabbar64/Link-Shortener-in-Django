# Link-Shortner-in-Django
A URL shortener is a simple tool that takes a long URL and turns it into whatever URL you would like it to be.

# What is a URL shortener?
I want to clarify that a URL shortener is the same as a link shortener… is the same as a link shrinker… a link compressor… a URL condenser… a vanity URL creator… I think that’s them all covered. They are all different ways of saying the same thing, which is that we want to take something long and ugly, then make it short and cute. To keep it simple, I will stick with the term URL shortener from today until the day I die.
